#   description: I thought I would never leave Tokyo. I actually still consider it the best city in the world, but thinking about the future of my family and the quality of life I want for my son, I decided to move to Utsunomiya, a smaller city of 500,000 people, located 100 km north of Tokyo. With half of the budget I had in mind to buy an old apartment in Tokyo, I bought a big, new, detached house, something that I would never have been able to afford in Tokyo. I am excited to begin this new chapter of my life in Utsunomiya, and I look forward to exploring all the amazing things this city has to offer.
