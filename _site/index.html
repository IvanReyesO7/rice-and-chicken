My name is Ivan, am a developer based in Utsunomiya, Japan. Currently working at <a href="https://group.gmo/">GMO Internet Company, Inc</a> as a Software Engineer. I have over 5 years of expirience working on Ruby on Rails projects. I created this GitHub site as a place where I can write posts, and also have a portfolio to showcase my experience.</p><p>I have always looked upon engineers who are confident enough to share their thoughs on blogs. So I wanted to start my own, not only to share what’s on my mind, but also to create the habit of maintaining a site, and writing what I am thinking at the moment. If you find typos or improper English grammar, it is likely due to 1. English is not my native language and 2. I am doing all of this without AI assistance, the site, the writtings and it’s infrastructure as well. It doesn’t mean that I hate AI because it will take over the world, steal our jobs, and our women. But I feel saturated by it, and I find myself using it even for small tasks. So I consider this as an AI-detox as well.</p><h2 id="what-does-rice-and-chicken-mean">What does Rice and Chicken mean?</h2><p>Well, it means that I like rice, and I like chicken.
