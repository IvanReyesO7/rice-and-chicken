## Introduction

Welcome to Rice and Chicken.
My name is Ivan, am a developer based in Tokyo, Japan.
Currently working at [GMO Internet Company, Inc](https://group.gmo/) as a Software Engineer.
I have over 5 years of expirience working on Ruby on Rails projects.
I created this GitHub site as a place where I can write posts, and also have a portfolio to showcase my experience.

I have always looked upon engineers who are confident enough to share their thoughs on blogs. So I wanted to start my own, not only to share what's on my mind, but also to create the habit of maintaining a site, and writing what I am thinking at the moment. If you find typos or improper English grammar, it is likely due to 1. English is not my native language and 2. I am doing all of this without AI assistance, the site, the writtings and it's infrastructure as well. It doesn't mean that I hate AI because it will take over the world, steal our jobs, and our women. But I feel saturated by it, and I find myself using it even for small tasks. So I consider this as an AI-detox as well.

## What does Rice and Chicken mean?

Well, it means that I like rice, and I like chicken.
Chicken is a great source of protein, and rice is a great source of carbohydrates. Together, they make a great meal.
It is also the name of a [Colombian typical dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arroz_con_pollo), which is made with rice, chicken, and a variety of other ingredients.
My mom makes the best rice and chicken in the world.
